- **View Summaries**: Users can view their own summaries and those shared with them.
- **Regenerate Summaries**: Users can provide feedback to regenerate summaries based on their input.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Material-UI
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB
- **Libraries**: Axios for API requests, PyPDF2 for PDF handling, Mistral for AI summarization

## AI Models Used
- Our tool uses the free-tier Mistral AI API to get access AI models.
- Code Summaries are generated by "Codestral Mamba" model and the rest are generated by "Mistral Nemo" model

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (for frontend)
- Python 3.x (any version > 3.12) and pip (for backend)
- MongoDB (for database)

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create --name cs520 python=3.12
   conda activate cs520
   ```

2. Install dependencies: 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. Set environment variables:\
   Update the below environment variables in the .env file in the backend folder.
   - SECRET_KEY can be any random string of your choice.
   - DATABASE_URL should have the uri of your MongoDB.
   - MISTRAL_API_KEY should have your Mistral AI API key. If you do not have one, steps to generate a new free tier Mistral AI API key can be found [here](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/quickstart/#:~:text=To%20get%20started%2C%20create%20a,clicking%20%22Create%20new%20key%22.).
   
   **Note** : A mail has been sent to the UMass CS520 instructors with link to the .env file that can be directly used here.  

4. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## Usage

1. **Register/Login**: Users can register or log in to access the application.
2. **Create Summary**: Users can create a new summary by selecting the type and input method (upload or type).
3. **Share Summary**: Users can share their summaries with other users by entering the recipient's email or username.
4. **View Summaries**: Users can view their own summaries and those shared with them.
5. **Regenerate Summary**: Users can provide feedback to regenerate existing summaries.
